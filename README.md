Simple analysis of Covid data from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.

If you see this by some chance, please don't read too much into it.
1) I'm not a data analyst - not even close.
2) I didn't invest much effort into verifying things etc.

To run it, use

$ jupyter notebook analyze.ipynb
