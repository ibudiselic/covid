Simple analysis of Covid data from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.

If you see this by some chance, please don't read too much into it:

1. I'm not a data analyst - not even close.

2. I'm not an epidemiologist - not even close.

3. I didn't invest much effort into verifying things etc.

I'm making no guarantees on the correctness of any of this. Listen to your
local authorities for authoritative information.

I usually update this once per day, morning time in Europe.

If you just want to look at the results (as opposed to the code), see:

To run the notebook, use:
